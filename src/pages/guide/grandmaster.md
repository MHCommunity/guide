## Training Grounds

{% location
 name="Training Grounds"

 description="A place of study, the students that train along the northern shore of the Burroughs River are indeed a worthy foe. Hunters who prove themselves as formidable opponents may earn the right to challenge the students' teachers."
/%}

Use Mutated Venus Mouse Trap, Dehydration Base and Brie Cheese.

## Bazaar

{% location
 name="Bazaar"
 src="/images/locations/bazaar.png"
 description="The organizers of the Bazaar used to travel abroad with a merchant companion named Ronza. During their visit to the Burroughs region, these quirky folk felt right at home, so much so that they decided to stay! Their newly constructed shops are now known across the Kingdom for their strange inventory."
/%}

You aren’t going to hunt in Bazaar. If you must, use a Physical or Tactical set-up with highest luck.

The most useful part of the Bazaar is the Cartographer, which sells and repairs map pieces.

Purchase Stitched Furoma Map Piece from Bazaar Cartographer. It’s quite expensive, so you may have to return to Mousoleum and Laboratory to earn the gold required.

Travel to Dojo once you have purchased the map piece.

## Dojo

{% location

- Catch a Student of the Cheese Claw Mouse to loot a Token of the Cheese Claw.

Maki Cheese increases the attraction rate of the above mice but is not worth the cost.

{% callout %}
A much faster way to obtain the tokens is via the King's Cart. You can buy 1 Cheese Belt Token Pack, 1 Cheese Claw Token Pack and 1 Cheese Fang Token Pack.
{% /callout %}

Travel to Meditation Room once you have at least 6 of each token.

## Meditation Room

{% location
 name="Meditation Room"
 src="/images/locations/meditation-room.png"

/%}

A Tactical weapon is needed to catch the mice in Meditation Room easily.

If you don’t have an Ambush Trap Blueprints yet, use Mutated Venus Mouse Trap, Dehydration Base, and Brie Cheese. Use Swiss Cheese if you’re low on gold.

 description="The stairs that lead to the third and final floor of the Pagoda are behind a thick, opulent set of double doors and are extremely well guarded.

It is recommended to arm charms like Chrome Charm to boost catch rate when using aforementioned crafted cheese.

Claim the adventure **Capture the Master of the Dojo** after you have caught Master of the Dojo Mouse.

## Great Gnarled Tree (Again)

Now that you have Ambush Trap, use it with Dehydration Base, and Brie Cheese to loot Gnarled Potions.

Collect at least 5 Gnarled Potions. It’s not a common drop, but it does show up as the Gift of the Day sometimes, so you may have some already.

Use Gnarled Potions to convert 55 Brie Cheese to Gnarled. The SUPERBrie+ conversion is not worth its cost.

Travel to Lagoon once you get at least 50 Gnarled Cheese.

## Lagoon

{% location
 name="Lagoon"
 src="/images/locations/lagoon.png"
 description="The enticing blue water hypnotizes hunters, distracting them from the dangerous mice that take up residence nearby. The terrain that surrounds the Lagoon is extremely unsteady, comprised of jagged rocks and slick moss. High up in the trees that surround the Lagoon are the nests of Harpy mice who act as a plague to all hunters, stealing their cheese, gold and crippling their courage. Some mice here are not attracted to conventional bait. It is highly recommended that a hunter use Gnarled cheese when hunting at the Lagoon."
/%}
