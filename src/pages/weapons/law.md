Law, the powertype that one is.
Law is one of the two 'young' powertypes alongside Rift. It was only added to the game in 2013, with the release of Claw Shot City. Despite Law's questionable impact for quite a while after release, it eventually evolved into the proper and usable powertype it is today. It is probably the least expensive powertype to fully gather, consistently providing traps that are quite underpriced compared to other powertypes' weapons for the same rank.

Law revolves around the idea of the law. Most of its mice are some form of criminals, burglars, or other justice-related topics.
Law was introduced and is primarily used in Varmint Valley, however its influence on the game has increased significantly since the release of Queso Canyon and the Floating Islands, the former providing Law with more practical use for lategame players.
