## Don't forget about these

The Forgotten power type of Forgotten weapons, with some of them being the most forgotten weapons in the game, used to hunt the Forgotten threats to the Kingdom. The first of these ancient relics was recovered from the Jungle of Dread, and it leads to the lost city of Zokor and beyond. The weapons usually revolve around using some of these old, lost arts to... outsmart mice with the technology from their time? I'm not sure, someone else should be finishing these powertype blurbs.
Maybe it's the technology used to beat them back when they were last seen?
