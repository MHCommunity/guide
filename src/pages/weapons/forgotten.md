Forgotten has a number of weapons that are very closely intertwined with one another. There are situations where a player conventionally would get a direct upgrade right after getting a weapon, by combining its parts with other items. Where this is applicable, this guide will only have an article under the name of the final weapon.

Welcome to Forgotten: The Forgotten power type of Forgotten weapons, with some of them being the most forgotten weapons in the game, used to hunt the Forgotten threats to the Kingdom. The first of these ancient relics was recovered from the Jungle of Dread, and it leads to the lost city of Zokor and beyond. The weapons usually revolve around using some of these old, lost arts to... outsmart mice with the technology from their time? I'm not sure, someone else should be finishing these powertype blurbs.
Maybe it's the technology used to beat them back when they were last seen?
