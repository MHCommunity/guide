 description="A chrome coated Storm Module with some other minor modifications has created this powerful and beautiful trap that even the great Ful'Mina herself can't scoff at. Firing overcharged harpoons, this upgraded model is magnetic and doesn't require a tether to reel the dragons in. After being speared, the harpoon releases its stored electricity into the target to incapacitate it. The trap then uses its vast power to create a focused electromagnetic field that brings the spear back with everything attached to it. "
