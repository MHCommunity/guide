### Weapon Acquisition
The Blazing Ember Spear Trap can be bought from the Trapsmith in Queso River, Prickly Plains and Canterra Quarry for 1,000,000 gold, 4 Ember Roots, 8 Ember Stones and 500 Nachore.
- Ember Roots are dropped by Inferna, The Engulfed, by using Flamin' Queso in the Prickly Plains.
- Ember Stones are dropped by Nachos, The Molten, by using Flamin' Queso in Canterra Quarry.
- Nachore is dropped by mice in Canterra Quarry.

### General Info and Trivia
The Blazing Ember Spear Trap is the second Draconic weapon a hunter usually runs into. It was released alongside the Queso region to be used in both Queso Geyser and the early stages of Moussu Picchu.
At its release, the BEST was intended to close the gap between the Ice Maiden and Moussu Picchu. Shortly after, Queso Geyser was released with an entire new group of Draconic-weak mice. Despite Queso Geyser being a Count-level area, its bosses are by most considered far beyond Count-level. This makes the go-to strategy for pre-Grand Duke/Duchess hunters to not spend too much time on them and return with better equipment.

### Alternatives
Draconic doesn't do alternatives.

### Upgrades
Unfortunately, the BEST is not *really* the 'best'. The conventional path after picking it up is some optional hunting in Queso Geyser, whereafter one (indirectly) heads towards Moussu PÃ¯cchu. Here, the upgrade you aim for is the [Chrome Storm >rought Ballista Trap](/weapons/draconic/cswb).
