 description="A devastating machine created with an incredibly rare rib of a terrifying dragon, housed in a heat-resistant shell. It draws power from the Kalor'ignis Rib stored within, focusing it in its centre, building a giant bubble of Draconic energy that expands outwards. Once it has expanded beyond critical mass, the outer blades begin to spin at an incredible velocity, shaping the energy from spherical to cylindrical and finally to a sharpened point. Once the formed mass of energy comes into contact with the point of the firing pin, it explodes forwards in an awesome beam of Draconic energy. Enhanced by dark dragon magic drawn from Ful'Mina's powerful tooth, its powerful energy can blast an additional Dragon Scale from the clutches of its victims."
