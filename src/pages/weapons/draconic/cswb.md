# General info and Trivia
The Chrome Stormwrought Ballista is the second best Draconic weapon, only being bested by an upgrade that uses its parts. Considering the price of its upgrade, this weapon is considered 'good enough' by many hunters. It is used in Queso Geyser, Moussu Picchu and the Floating Islands.
Next to its nice shine and decent stats, both the non-chromed and the chromed Storm Wrought Ballista have a secondary effect: whenever a Storm Dragon in Moussu Picchu drops any dragon scales, it will drop an additional one.

### Alternatives
Draconic doesn't do alternatives.

### Upgrades
After getting chromed, people assumed this weapon would be Draconic's best trap for quite a while. Soon after, another Draconic area released: the Queso Geyser. With its release, Draconic also got a new best in slot weapon, consuming this chromed ballista and creating the true weapon that beats ancient dragons: the [Dragon Slayer Cannon](/weapons/draconic/dsc).
