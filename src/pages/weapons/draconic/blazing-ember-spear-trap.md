 description="A mighty Ember Root grows atop a bed of blazing Ember Stone. Poised with a Golden Spear forged from the leaves meticulously hand-plucked from several seasons of Ember Root growth, this mighty root heats the spear to 1 degree below its melting point before hurling it with unmeasurable speed towards its target. Only the finest leaves are picked to be wrapped and hammered in order to fulfill each spear's dragon-destroying destiny."
