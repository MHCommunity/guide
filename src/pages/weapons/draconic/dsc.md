### Weapon Acquisition
The Dragon Slayer Cannon is crafted in multiple stages:
- The Dragon Slayer Cannon Chassis, requiring 310 Cork Bark, 15 Congealed Rubber, 30 Geyserite, 60 Tungsten and 300 Tiny Platinum Bars
- The Imbued Dragon Slayer Cannon Chassis, requiring the Chassis from earlier, 1 Ful'Mina's Tooth, 2 Ember Roots and 2 Ember Stones
- The Dragon Slayer Cannon itself, requiring the Imbued Dragon Slayer Cannon Chassis, 1 Kalor'ignis Rib, 1 Chrome Storm Wrought Ballista Parts and 415 Dragon Scale.

These can be acquired in the following ways:
- Dragon Scales can be looted from Storm Dragons, by arming Dragonvine Cheese in Moussu Picchu.
- Chrome Storm Wrought Ballista Parts can be acquired by smashing a Chrome Storm Wrought Ballista Trap.
- A Kalor'ignis Rib can be purchased from the Marketplace, or very rarely looted in Dragon Nests after catching Kalor'ignis of the Geyser
- Ember Roots are dropped by Inferna, The Engulfed, by using Flamin' Queso in the Prickly Plains.
- Ember Stones are dropped by Nachos, The Molten, by using Flamin' Queso in Canterra Quarry.
- Ful'Mina's Tooth can be looted from Ful'Mina, The Mountain Queen. Addionally, they can be purchased for Dragon Scales in the Moussu Picchu General Store or picked up from the Marketplace.
- Cork Bark, Congealed Rubber, Geyserite and Tungsten can be looted in Queso Geyser.
- Tiny Platinum Bars can be bought from many General Stores.



# General info and Trivia
The Dragon Slayer Cannon is the most recently added Draconic weapon. It's a massive cannon. It shoots Dragons.
The Dragon Slayer cannon is used for Queso Geyser's dragons, some Moussu Picchu hunting and the Floating Islands.
The Dragon Slayer Cannon retains the bonus effect from the storm ballistas, providing extra Dragon Scales when hunting the Storm Dragons in Moussu Picchu.
It's a massive cannon. What more do you want me to say?

### Alternatives
Draconic doesn't do alternatives.
Although this undoubtably IS the most optional draconic trap out there. There is no content in the game that is unplayable without it. A rib may cost you an arm and a leg, so for the more casual hunter just a ballista may be enough.
