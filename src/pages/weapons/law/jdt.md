## Judge Droid Trap
60 years is a realistic estimate of how long it will take before I want to use this.
<mark> This weapon is not a part of the regular progression path and is generally considered 'optional'.</mark>

### Weapon Acquisition
The Judge Droid Trap can be purchased from the Trapsmith in Queso River, Prickly Plains and Canterra Quarry for 470,000 gold.

### General Info and Trivia
The Judge Droid Trap is an in-between Law trap that was introduced with the release of Queso Canyon and was intended to be a mild downgrade replacement for the Prison pair. This was done because a fully map-or-marketplace locked weapon was considered inconvenient for a significant part of the community. This immediately identifies the group for which this weapon could be convenient: non-community active (or non-mapping) hunters that don't want to use the marketplace for the Portal pieces required.

### Alternatives
The Judge Droid Trap is already an alternative for the Meteor and Ember Prison Core Traps. While it is a significant downgrade in comparison to them, it is designed to cover the gap not getting them would leave.

### Upgrades
After the Judge Droid or Ember Prison Core Trap, the end of Law is near with the Floating Islands' upgrade to finish it all off: the [S.T.I.N.G.E.R](/weapons/shadow/stinger).
