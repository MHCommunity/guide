 description="With the scales of justice forever tipped in their favour, this self-appointed court of droids enforces their own laws within the courtroom. Among them you will find: falsified evidence, fake witnesses, a biased judge, and a stenographer that only writes down incriminating words and ignores the defense. This trap finds all mice guilty until proven guiltier. Once judged, the bailiff brings all offenders to the King's Stockade to rot. The mice are real, the cases are real, the rulings are final. This is Judge Droid."
