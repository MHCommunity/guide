## S.L.A.C.

-king is what this weapon does. But it's the best option so I guess it'll do.

### Weapon Acquisition

The S.L.A.C. can be purchased from the Trapsmith in Claw Shot City for 150,000 gold.

### General Info and Trivia

The S.L.A.C. is the first Law weapon most hunters obtain, and is used primarily for hunting in Claw Shot City. It can also be used in the Gnawnia Express Station if you plan on doing this area at its intended rank. Depending on the rest of your setup, it can be interesting for the Day phase of Fort Rox as well: if your other setup parts have enough stats to compensate for it, the S.L.A.C. outperforms the A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. here, however this is unlikely with regular progression.
The S.L.A.C. was originally introduced alongside Law with the release of Claw Shot City. The powertype unfortunately remained quite weak until the release of Fort Rox, which introduced the Meteor Prison Core Trap

### Alternatives

The S.L.A.C. doesn't really have an alternative, as it is the very first law weapon available to hunters.
The closest to an alternative it has is the S.L.A.C. II, however this weapon requires loot from Claw Shot City, an area weak to only Law, to purchase. The Gnawnia Express Station has a number of traps in a similar boat: while they are upgrades to the S.L.A.C. stat-wise, they require Law-gathered loots to purchase and are conventionally not looked at as worthwhile upgrades.
Law has a second theoretical entry point in the Judge Droid Trap, which is provided in Queso Canyon. Unfortunately, this trajectory requires too many shenanigans to elaborate upon in this guide, so reach out to the community or try crafting your own path if this option piques your interest.

### Upgrades

After the S.L.A.C., the next go-to Law weapon is the [Meteor Prison Core Trap](/weapons/law/mpct) in Fort Rox. Unfortunately, this weapon (and its direct upgrade) is fully locked behind either maps or the Marketplace, which leads to the introduction of a stopgap Law weapon until the next step in the upgrade path: the [Judge Droid Trap](/weapons/law/jdt).
