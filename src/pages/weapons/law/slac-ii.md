 description="The S.L.A.C. II is an improvement from its predecessor in two ways: The 'S' in the acronym now stands for 'sling', and the sling itself. Utilizing the technology of what our scientists are calling 'a very large rubber band', the S.L.A.C. II is able to harmlessly* sling mice away from your cheese and back into the desert. The slinging process itself does not harm the mouse."
