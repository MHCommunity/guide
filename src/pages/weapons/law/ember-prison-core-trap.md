- Unstable Ember Gadgets are dropped by Queen Quesada, by using Wildfire Queso in Queso River.
- Ember Roots are dropped by Inferna, The Engulfed, by using Flamin' Queso in the Prickly Plains.
- Ember Stones are dropped by Nachos, The Molten, by using Flamin' Queso in Canterra Quarry.
- Nachore is dropped by mice in Canterra Quarry.

### General Info and Trivia

The Ember Prison Core Trap is Queso Canyon's Law upgrade and one of the best Law weapons in the game. While it is still very cheap for its power level, it is one of the go-to power types to abuse in the Floating Islands. Additionally, it is often used by hunters for various collection and crowning goals because it is sufficient for most of the Law hunting currently in the game.

### Alternatives

Law has a second theoretical entrypoint in the [Judge Droid Trap](/weapons/law/jdt), which is provided in Queso Canyon. While it is weaker than either this or the next Prison Core trap, it only requires gold and is an alternative to the Meteor Prison's mapping requirements.

### Upgrades

After the Ember Prison Core Trap, the end of Law is near with the Floating Islands' upgrade to finish it all off: the [S.T.I.N.G.E.R](/weapons/shadow/stinger).
