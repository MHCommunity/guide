 description="The fire-powered fist propels itself toward the mice below and is especially effective against Fueler mice. It uses leftover steam from the train's engine to power itself, but what it draws in power from the engine it more than makes up for in its effectiveness. Worry not, it won't hinder the train's speed in any way! Using this trap will help hunters catch more of the Fueler mice and collect more Fuel Nuggets, powering the train's engine to great speeds! This trap is very effective while the Gnawnian Express is approaching Daredevil Canyon."
