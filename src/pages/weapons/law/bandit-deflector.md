 description="Powered by a secret pyrite mixture (known as 'Nitrogen Lawcide') passed down from law-man Marshall Lawson to the young aspiring lawful hunters. This pneumatic icon of the law is the perfect way to deter any and all lawbreakers! Once triggered, the ramp locks release, causing the Lawcide-powered, law-abiding, law-legs to lawnch forward (known as the 'Law Lawnch Effect'), providing the thrust required to slam the shield into the mice, propelling them backwards and away from the train. 'I fought the law, and the law fought back.' --Unknown incarcerated raider This trap is very effective while the Gnawnian Express is passing through Raider River."
