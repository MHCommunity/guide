### Weapon Acquisition
The Meteor Prison Core Trap can be purchased from the Trapsmith in Fort Rox for 1,200,000 gold, 1 Meteoric Core Fragments, 60 Howlite and 10 Bloodstone.
- Howlite and Bloodstone are dropped during the night phase in Fort Rox, with their main source being the early and late stages of the night respectively.
- Meteoric Core Fragments are dropped by the Heart of the Meteor, which can be caught during Fort Rox' Dawn stage by arming Sunrise Cheese after activating a Portal Projector.

### General Info and Trivia
The Meteor Prison Core Trap is Fort Rox' Law upgrade. For a while, it was the only respectable permanent Law weapon in the game. While it is a solid weapon, it unfortunately doesn't have much mandatory use. By the time you get it, you probably won't need much more Fort Rox dawn farming, and the next stop for it would be Queso River. Queso River is then made somewhat obsolete by the existence of Queso's maps, leaving its only function to gather the Unstable Ember Gadgets needed to upgrade it into the Ember Prison Core Trap. Despite this sorry state of use, it is still a very interesting weapon to acquire, considering it's required for the next Law trap: the Ember Prison Core.

### Alternatives
Law has a second theoretical entry point in the [Judge Droid Trap](/weapons/law/jdt), which is provided in Queso Canyon. While it is weaker than either this or the next Prison Core trap, it only requires gold and is an alternative to the Meteor Prison's mapping requirements.

### Upgrades
After the Meteor Prison Core Trap, the next go-to Law weapon is the [Ember Prison Core Trap](/weapons/law/epct) in Queso Canyon. This weapon fortunately has a lot more direct usage.
