### Weapon Acquisition

The Mutated Venus Mouse Trap can be purchased from various Trapsmiths spread over primarily Furoma and Whisker Woods. Most notable of those are the Great Gnarled Tree, Lagoon, Bazaar, the Dojo and cape Cape Clawed.
To purchase this trap, the following is needed:

- a Venus Mouse Trap is needed, which can be bought in the same locations for 220,000 Gold.
- 20 Radioactive Sludge, which can be obtained from staling Radioactive Blue Cheese or opening a Pollution Controll Supply Kit, which can be purchased from the King's Cart.

I'm honestly not sure where to go from here
