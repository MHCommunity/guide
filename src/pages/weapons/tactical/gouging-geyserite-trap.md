 description="A devious canopy of Amber Queso stalactites and stalagmites await any hungry mice that approach this trap. Once a mouse takes a sip of cheese, the resonating sound from the slurp bounces off of the back of the cave wall and begins to vibrate the stalactites overhead, causing them to dislodge and trap the mouse in a cage of fallen queso.

The fallen shards melt back into the reservoir beneath and get pulled back up into the canopy to slowly drip and form new stalactites. A completely self-renewable trap system!"
