### Weapon Acquisition
The Horrific Venus Mouse Trap can be purchased from the Trapsmith in Cape Clawed and Nerg Plains. To purchase this trap, the following items are needed:
- 20 Radioactive Sludge, which can be obtained from staling Radioactive Blue Cheese or opening a Pollution Controll Supply Kit, which can be purchased from the King's Cart.
- a Thorned Venus Mouse Trap, which can be purchased in the same locations for 550,000 gold, 1 Venus Mouse Trap Husk and 1 Thorned Vine
- - a Venus Mouse Trap Husk can be acquired by smashing either a [Mutated Venus Mouse Trap](/weapons/tactical/mvmt) or a Venus Mouse Trap.
- - a Thorned Vine can be acquired by catching a Grandfather Mouse in Cape Clawed, using Gumbo Cheese.


I'm honestly not sure where to go from here
