 description="Between these two pillars lies an anomaly of time and space, a void which emits a siren song that only mice of the Mystic Team can hear. The Mystic King uses pieces of this stone to gather his minions to him in times of crisis, but these monoliths emit enough hypnotic vibrations to draw even the King himself between the pillars. Once the mice pass through this gate, they step into another plane of being, never to return. Not very effective against Technic mice."
