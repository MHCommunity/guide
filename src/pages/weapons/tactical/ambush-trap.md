### Weapon Acquisition

The Ambush Trap can be purchased from the Trapsmith in the Dojo, Meditation Room and Pinnacle Chamber for 63,410 Gold, 1 Master's Seal and 1 Ambush Trap Blueprints

- A Master's Seal can be crafted by combining a Master Belt Shard, Master Claw Shard and Master Fang Shard, which are guaranteed loots from the Masters of the Cheese Belt, Claw and Fang respectively.
- Ambush Trap Blueprints are dropped by Happless, Assassin and Worker mice. The easiest method of acquisition is hunting with regular cheese in the Pinnacle Chamber to guarantee attracting a Happless Mouse.

I'm honestly not sure where to go from here
