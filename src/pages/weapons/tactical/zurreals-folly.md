 description="This trap is the only devised tool suspected of being able to capture Zurreal the Eternal. A harmless looking bookshelf features literature designed to intrigue Zurreal, distracting him from the trap hidden behind the shelf. The traps's design is complex, but it's utility is simple: Drain all magical and electrical energy in the immediate area. The trap is powered by undead ectoplasm to remain active while using augmented metal netting and runic rocks to open a small hole to another dimension and vacuum all other energy far away. This trap should be enough to knock Zurreal's walking throne out of commission, leaving him mostly helpless. WARNING: Do not try to operate Droids, heavy machinery or magics anywhere near this trap while activated!"
