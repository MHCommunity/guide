 description="At a glance, this inconspicuous-looking boulder blends in seamlessly with the local geological formations. This remarkable creation can detect infinitesimal seismic waves in the ground caused by even the tiniest mouse scurrying in the vicinity. Upon detection, the trap activates instantly, causing it to roll into action, and unfold onto its prey. Once caught, it traps the mouse by sealing it into a nearby rock face using its tail-mounted laser cutter and then marks it for later retrieval."
