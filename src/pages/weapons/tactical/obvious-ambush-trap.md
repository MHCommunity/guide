 description="This little robot's not fooling anyone, but with a laser-sighted, explosive-shooting cannon at his side, he doesn't really have to. Because of the Technic King's passion for heavy artillery, Technic Mice have an irresistible compulsion to battle any strange technology and acquire it for the team. Even an obvious ambush brings Technics running in hopes that they can be the one to bring a new weapon home to the King. Not very effective against the Mystic mice."
