 description="When Mystic Pawns see the glowing energies from this trap, they flock to it, hoping to top up their reserve. The Hunter must then whisper the forbidden words which direct the crane arm, positioning it over the hapless pawn before the allotted time passes. If the spell is said correctly, the runic claw drops down and nabs the Mystic Pawn. Technic Pawn armour is too cumbersome for the Arcane Crane, making them fall out of the claw before it gets a good grip. Not very effective against Technic Mice."
