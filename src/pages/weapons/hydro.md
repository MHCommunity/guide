Welcome to Hydro, the powertype of Wet. If it walks like a fish, talks like a fish or looks like a fish, this is probably the powertype you will want to catch it with.
hydro is the primary weapon type used in Rodentia, as well as the Elub tribe, the Living Garden and some parts of other regions. The current Best in Slot, the Chrome School of Sharks, can be acquired surprisingly early at Count, but is surprisingly expensive for its rank.

Hydro is one of the harder types to guide people in. It has a surprising number of barely known shady sidepath-traps in the earlygame and has a close to best-in-slot in the Queso Fount Trap that, despite being inferior in stats, is significantly cheaper as well.
