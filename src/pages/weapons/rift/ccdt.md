# General info and Trivia
The Chrome Celestial Dissonance Weapon is the current best-in-game Rift weapon. While its only progress-use is in the area where it is obtained, the Valour Rift, it is still one of the best weapons in the game. This is because a hunter's performance in the Valour Rift determines the stats on their Prestige Base. This is currently the best base in the game by a significant margin, making it a must-get for the endgame.

# Alternatives
The Celestial Dissonance Trap is the current best in slot Rift weapon in the game.
