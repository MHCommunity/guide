 description="By combining the altered high technology scavenged from the most powerful Burroughs Rift mice and the remains of a smashed Crystal Tower, Digby scientists have learned how to focus Rift Power into a terrible laser beam capable of bringing the fight to the Rift mice like never before!

By focusing all the Crystal Laser technology into a single beam, the most power possible can be directed at a single target. This trap's high power combines exceptionally well with the Rift Power Charm's power bonus, and makes this trap fantastic for catching tougher Rift mice, though it suffers slightly against the remainder of the weaker, sneakier Rift mice.Riftwalker SetRequired: Rift Base, Weapon, and CharmSet Bonus (2 pieces):+20% Power BonusSet Bonus (3 pieces):+20% Power Bonus+5 Luck"
