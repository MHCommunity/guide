### Weapon Acquisition
The Crystal Tower can be bought directly from the Trapsmith for 4,900,000 Gold and 1 Raw Rift Crystal in the Gnawnia Rift.
- A Raw Rift Crystal can be acquired by catching a Goliath Field Mouse.

### General Info and Trivia
The Crystal Tower is the first Rift weapon a player usually picks up. It can be acquired from Gnawnia Rift, where you'll get the needed Raw Rift Crystal from completing the adventure. Because you don't have a rift-type weapon to challenge this area, the conventional, and only permanently available, strategy is to take your strongest weapon for this (and try to convince the mice peacefully that they don't need to see your brute force in action). Go-to weapons for this are the Sphynx Wrath and Enraged RhinoBot/Sandstorm Monstrobot. If you have one of the Queso Geyser weapons, or a limited edition rift weapon, these could work better as well.
The Crystal Tower is somewhat underperforming in the stats departement, making a good base alongside it very important. For those who want to put in the effort, the Rift Base can be a good fit. Other, more conventional, options are bases like the Overgrown Ember Stone Base and a 10 or more luck base from events.
While hunting with the Crystal Tower, its low stats make the use of auras, charms and the Lucky Golden Shield a lot more beneficial than they otherwise are.
The Crystal Tower is primarily used in the early rift areas, untill a hunter can upgrade to the [M.Y.N.O.R.C.A.](/weapons/rift/mynorca) in Furoma Rift or the [Multi-Crystal Laser](/weapons/rift/mcl) in Burroughs Rift. Depending on the exact route, this makes the trap useful in Whisker Woods Rift, Burroughs Rift and potentially Furoma Rift.
### Alternatives
The Crystal Tower doesn't have any permanently available alternatives, which is impressive considering how bad it is. While "whack hard" works for some of the early rifts, it is still not recommended, and the later upgrades either require rift hunting or having the Crystal Tower to upgrade.

### Upgrades
From the Crystal Tower, a hunter can go two routes to upgrade their rift equipment. At Duke, they could upgrade to the [Multi-Crystal Laser](/weapons/rift/mcl) in Burroughs Rift. Alternatively, there is the stronger [M.Y.N.O.R.C.A.](/weapons/rift/mynorca) in Furoma Rift that becomes available at Grand Duke.
