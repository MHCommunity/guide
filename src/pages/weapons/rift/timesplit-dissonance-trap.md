 description="Assembled here is a monstrous trap of arcing electrical surges, pumping straight from the quantum quartz in the center. When a mouse triggers this trap, it is subjected to an infinite timeline of catch attempts to find one where it is caught. Unfortunately, sometimes the timeline it finds is not your own, giving an alternative reality version of yourself credit for the catch. Hey, at least it's nice to know one of the many versions of you is always catching a mouse!Riftwalker SetRequired: Rift Base, Weapon, and CharmSet Bonus (2 pieces):+20% Power BonusSet Bonus (3 pieces):+20% Power Bonus+5 Luck"
