### Weapon Acquisition
The Timesplit Dissonance Weapon can be purchased from the Burroughs Rift Trapsmith for 36,400,000 gold, 10 Timesplit Runes and 50 Clockwork Cogs. It requires 1,000,000,001 points to be armed, so be warned against buying it prematurely and getting your money unnecesearily stuck.
- Clockwork Cogs can be acquired from the Bristle Woods Rift. Their primary source is from the Absolute Acolyte, either through their Mysterious Rift Box or through direct drops. They can also be exchanged from the Bristle Woods Rift General Store for 500 Tiny Sprockets, but this is significantly less efficient.
- Timesplit Runes very rarely drop from the Absolute Acolyte and his box, but are primarily obtained through either the Marketplace or the Bristle Woods Rift General Store. In the latter, they can be bought for 50 Clockwork Cogs.

### General info and Trivia
The Timesplit Dissonance Weapon is the two-but-Best In Slot Rift weapon currently available. Both weapons that beat it follow from it, making it a must-get weapon for any hunter with rifty ambitions. It used to be one of the true top tier weapons in the game (both in performance and cost), and still has a crucial role in preparing hunters for the next rift: Valour Rift.
Valour Rift is an extremely ~~broken~~ centralising Archduke area because it provides access to what is by far the strongest base in the game: the Prestige base. You would assume that jumping in there is a high-priority goal for any fresh archduke Unfortunately, the points requirement on the Timesplit Dissonance Trap makes this unfavorable because most hunters would rank up before hitting it.

### Alternatives
The Timesplit Dissonance Weapon has no alternatives, primarily because the current best-in-slot Rift weapon requires it to be acquired.

### Upgrades
After finishing up the timesplit's chapter in the Bristle Woods Rift, there is only one stop left: Straight to the Valour Rift and it's [Chrome Celestial Dissonance Trap](/weapons/rift/ccdt).
