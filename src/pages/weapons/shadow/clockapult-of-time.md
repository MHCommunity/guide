 description="As a golden platform accelerates near 88 miles per hour, the hands of this spooky-looking clock begin to spin with incredible speed. With a faint flash of purple light, the mouse is sent far into the future. To an outside observer, the trap appears to trigger in the blink of an eye, but to a mouse caught within the event, the journey seems much, much longer. The clock begins to blur as the hands spin faster and faster. The clock face glows eerily as everything that was once the present blends to what was once the future."
