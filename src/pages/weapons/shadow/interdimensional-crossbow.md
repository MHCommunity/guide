 description="These finely-tuned crossbows create an interdimensional network between all other Interdimensional Crossbow Traps in existence. In synchronization with each other, once one of the traps detects a mouse, each of the other traps opens a portal to the offending location so that they may aid by opening fire upon the same target at once! It makes you wonder why all traps aren't made this way!"
