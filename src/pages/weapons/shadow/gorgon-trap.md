 description="Made from the eye of the Gorgon, a hideous monster with hair made of snakes, this trap will literally scare mice stiff, turning them into living statues. Hunters with visions of figurine collections dancing in their head may be disappointed that the perfect little mouse statues only last for a few hours before they thaw out, but thatâ€™s certainly long enough to throw them into a sack and send them to a safe location."
