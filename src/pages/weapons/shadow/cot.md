### Weapon Acquisition
The Clockapult of Time can be purchased from the Trapsmith in multiple locations in the Tribal Isles for 1,800,000 gold.

### General Info and Trivia
The Clockapult of Time is one of the Tribal Isles' Shadow weapons alongside the Gorgon Trap.  Considering how big of a deal gold is in the early-game, both of these weapons are not as desirable for a standard playthrough but they can still be picked up to make a few stages easier.
The Clockapult of Time has a significant increase in stats in comparison to the Bottomless Grave, unlike the other optional Shadow trap: the Creepy Coffin Trap. Unfortunately, it has quite few use cases. For a conventional playthrough of the game, it would only be used to catch six or so mice in the Jungle of Dread and a couple of hunts in the Seasonal Garden to get a map piece. On top of this, the Jungle of Dread has Dreaded Charms to make a trap upgrade for this area even less interesting. At this point, a weapon of nearly two million gold is simply not worth the effort put into getting the gold.
In the past, the pair of Tribal Isles Shadow weapons were more appealing. But with the release of Fort Rox it is well worth it to hold off getting a better Shadow weapon until then.

### Alternatives
This weapon is already an alternative, to the [Bottomless Grave](/weapons/shadow/bg).
### Upgrades
After the Clockapult of Time, there are a number of potential weapons to go for. Shadow is in a bit of an awkward spot because it is quite underused or avoidable for a sizeable chunk of the game. The go-to upgrade after the Clockapult of Time is often the [Interdimensional Crossbow Trap](/weapons/shadow/IDCT).
