### General Info and Trivia
The Chrome Temporal Turbine is the final step for Shadow at this point in time, with no Shadow weapon beating or contesting its place as the best available.
The Chrome Temporal Turbine is a very expensive piece of equipment, as one would expect from a best in slot weapon. Its components cost over 50 million gold. This is without including the price of the Temporal Shadow Plates, which at times could make its total price over triple that.
The Chrome Temporal Turbine is primarily used in Moussu Picchu's rainy stage and the Floating Islands' Shadow islands. It also makes hunting in some earlier areas like the Sand Dunes, Fort Rox and Canterra Quarry a lot more comfortable.
It has been hinted that Shadow will (eventually) be used in the Folklore Forest as well, but specifics on this are currently lacking, making it difficult to properly set expectations for this.



### Alternatives
The Chrome Temporal Turbine is the current Best in Slot Shadow weapon in the game. There are no upgrades nor alternatives.
