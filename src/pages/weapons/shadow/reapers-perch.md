 description="Perched atop Monolith Slabs, the deadly Reaper Droid gazes through smoke awaiting prey. Upon bait being lifted from the stone plate, the runic glyphs begin to glow, mesmerizing the mouse into a state of anhedonia, allowing the droid to descend upon the mouse with little resistance. Where the rodent goes once taken by the droid is up to the will of the hunter."
