 description="A bed for the dead! Undead mice see this as one big bed and breakfast. Armed with a delicious bait, mood enhancing fog, old musty wooden scent and topped with a beautiful display of gnarled trees, who could resist!?

Unbeknownst to potential visitors, this coffin has a permanent resident confined within its 6 walls and it doesn't take kindly to house guests...

As an added bonus, it produces an extra Cemetery Slat when one is dropped within the Mousoleum."
