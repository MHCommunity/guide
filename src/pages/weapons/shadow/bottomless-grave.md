### Weapon Acquisition

The Bottomless Grave can be bought directly from the Trapsmith for 65,400 Gold in a number of locations, most notably the Laboratory and the Mousoleum.

### General Info and Trivia

The Bottomless Grave is the first Shadow weapon most hunters should aim for these days. Shadow has been a key component of early-game gold farming for a long time, and to this day the Bottomless Grave is a key component to properly using how powerful the Mousoleum is.
In the past, the Bottomless Grave was significantly less desirable because it had a significantly higher cost. A major drop in price, combined with a buff to the Mousoleum in its 2018 rework, managed to change this and fundamentally reshape the earlier section of the Shadow power type.

### Alternatives

The [Creepy Coffin Trap](/weapons/shadow/coffin) is an alternative to the Bottomless Grave. While being similar in stats and only accessible through either the Marketplace or the Premium Shoppe, it has an area-specific effect in the Mousoleum that can make up for this downside depending on the resources you have available.

### Upgrades

After the Bottomless Grave, there are a number of potential weapons to go for. Shadow is in a bit of an awkward spot because it is quite underused or avoidable for a sizeable chunk of the game. The go-to upgrade after the Bottomless Grave is often the [Interdimensional Crossbow Trap](/weapons/shadow/IDCT).
An in-between weapon that can be considered is the [Clockapult of Time](/weapons/shadow/CoT). This upgrade is considered optional because its use is quite minor: the only places it would be used are a low number of hunts in the Jungle of Dread, and in the Seasonal Garden to acquire a map piece. The next expected use would be in Fort Rox, however the Arcane ACRONYM beats it in catch rate here. Because of this, the Clockapult is considered unnecessary.
