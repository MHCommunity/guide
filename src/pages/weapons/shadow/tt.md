### Weapon Acquisition
The Temporal Turbine can be purchased from the Trapsmith in the Labyrinth and Zokor for 10,500,000 gold, 2 Temporal Shadow Plates, 1 Infused Plate and 225 Plates of Fealty.
- An Infused Plate can be acquired by catching a Paladin Weapon Master in Zokor's highest tier Fealty district. Alternatively, they are very rare drops from Ful'Mina's Gifts and Ful'Mina, The Mountain Queen. It can also be acquired by smashing a Minotaur Key.
- Plates of Fealty are dropped in Zokor's Fealty district.
- A Temporal Shadow Plate is a rare drop from the Retired Minotaur. Ful'Mina, the Mountain Queen has a very small chance to drop them as well. Because of this, the Marketplace is where they are usually picked up.

### General Info and Trivia
The Temporal Turbine is the one-but-final step for Shadow at this point in time, with its only upgrade being the Chrome Temporal Turbine crafted from its parts and the Chrome Temporal Turbine kit.
While the Temporal Shadow Plates needed for the weapon are often quite expensive for a Duke/Duchess weapon, this concern gets nimbly evaded by the weapon not being mandatory as fast as usual trap upgrades. Duke/Duchess and Grand Duke/Duchess have fairly little use for Shadow, with only Moussu Picchu needing a little Shadow for one of its farming stages. This makes it possible to focus on other goals like the Rifts until a hunter is ready to tackle the Floating Islands at Archduke/Archduchess. Here, having an upgraded Shadow weapon is heavily recommended. Additionally, by being a component of the current best in slot Shadow weapon (the [Chrome Temporal Turbine](/weapons/shadow/ctt)), this weapon could be considered an eventual must-get for most hunters anyway.


### Alternatives
While the Temporal Turbine does not have any alternatives, its lack of direct use makes it possible to delay obtaining the weapon. Any hunter planning to get Shadow's Best In Slot weapon would still eventually be forced to get around to obtaining it.

### Upgrades
After the Temporal Turbine, only one shadow trap is left to beat it: the [Chrome Temporal Turbine](/weapons/shadow/ctt)
