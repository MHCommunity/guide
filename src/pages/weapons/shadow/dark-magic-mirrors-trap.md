 description="This ornate and ominous three-sided mirror is said to be enchanted with the darkest magic in Gnawnia. Its magic is so powerful that any mouse who dabbles in the dark arts cannot help themselves but to gaze eagerly into its mysterious panes.

Each majestic panel serves a unique purpose in the process of catching the unfortunate and unsuspecting mice who dare approach it. One mirror shows an unspoken truth to fill them with doubt. Another mirror shows them an alluring but unreachable place to fill them with longing. The final mirror shows them a magnified and distorted image of themselves to fill them with dread. As the three reflections converge, the mouse is driven nearly to madness and will seek refuge between the cracks in the mirrors. Once they venture beyond the glass, they disappear into a strange, shadowy realm never to return.

Hunters are recommended to avert their eyes and keep a safe distance before uttering the phrase: "Magic Mirrors on my base, vanish this mouse without a trace!""
