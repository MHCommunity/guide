 description="Combining magical theorems from previous portal traps with "modern" clockwork technology, the Clockwork Portal Trap represents the pinnacle of Shadow trap development. Lying dormant until a mouse attempts to steal a piece of cheese, it looks fairly unassuming, if complicated. But the moment a mouse steps upon it, pre-charged capacitors flood it with energy, instantly creating a super-powered portal that whisks the mouse off to who knows where... or when."
