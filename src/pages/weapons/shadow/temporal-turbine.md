 description="Desolate and disheartening, this trap paints a picture of a bleak and meaningless existence, even when observed in its resting state. When a mouse approaches, the Temporal Turbine begins to hum, spinning violently and churning impossibly dark clouds, forming a direct link with the depths of a void in space beyond our plane of existence. Once the mouse begins to gaze into the contraption, the turbine links with the mind of the mouse, implanting the image of a mouse utopia, convincing it to surrender itself as it astrally-projects the soul of the mouse into space, leaving behind a dormant husk, never to return."
