# Steam Laser
Time to melt some crystalized silver

<mark>Disclaimer:</mark> Usually, pages hosting multiple traps will have the end result mentioned first and go from there. Due to the nature of the Steam Laser traps, this is NOT the case here.

## Steam Laster Mk I

|||||
|---|---|---|---|
| __Power__ 	| 4,200 	| __Luck__ 	| 14 	|
| __Power Bonus__ 	| 8% 	|__AttractionBonus__ 	| 0% 	|

| __Acquisition Method__ 	| Trapsmith	| __Cost__ 	| 345,000 gold <br> 4 Wire Spool <br> 4 Heating Oil <br> Frosty Metal	|

### Weapon Acquisition
The Steam Laser Mk. I can be purchased from the Trapsmith in the Slushy Shoreline or the Iceberg for 345,000 gold and 4 of each Wire Spools, Heating Oil and Frosty Metal.
These 3 materials can all be looted from hunting in the Slushy Shoreline while using Softserve charms. They can also drop from the chests rewarded when finishing an Iceberg run fast enough, but that is usually not a usable source at this stage (the Iceberg Strongbox, Supply Chest and Treasure Chest)

## Steam Laster Mk II

- The acquisition method of the Steam Laser Mk. I is described above.
- 4 Bottled Cold Fusions can be acquired from hunting Icewing's Generals in the Iceberg. You should have this number after your first iceberg run.
- 12 Wire Spools, Heating Oils and Frosty Metals can all be looted from hunting in the Slushy Shoreline while using Softserve charms. They can also drop from the chests rewarded when finishing an Iceberg run fast enough, but that is not a consistent source at this stage (the Iceberg Strongbox, Supply Chest and Treasure Chest).
- a Well-Sealed Cannister can be looted from a Frostwing Commander, the boss present in Icewing's Lair during your first Iceberg run.

The Steam Laser Mk. III can be purchased from the Trapsmith in the Slushy Shoreline or the Iceberg for 1 Steam Laser Mk. II parts and 1 Steam Nine.
- Steam Laser Mk. II Parts can be acquired by smashing a 'Steam Laser Mk II (broken!)', which can be acquired by catching icewing with a Steam Laser Mk. II.
- Steam Nine is dropped by Icewing, which can be found in Icewing's Lair.

### General Info and trivia
The Steam Lasers are a range of weapons that can be acquired by doing the Iceberg adventure. They can help out a little in the Seasonal Garden, after which they could come in handy up untill a hunter picks up the Queso Fount Trap (or the School of Sharks). Depending on routing, this can include the Fiery Warpath's mages, the Living Garden, the Fungal Cavern and the Sunken City.
The most important thing to note about this line is that the final upgrade is **fully optional**. The whole Steam Laser line has a stat boost in the Iceberg, but the weapons' stats pre-boost remain the same between mkII and mkIII. If your plan is to get out as soon as possible, finishing that second iceberg run can be postponed. In a conventional route, however, this happening is quite unlikely because Lord/Lady as a rank is quite long, and you might just need the Iceberg to rank up.

### Alternatives
Because of where the Lasers are located in the game, there aren't really any interesting alternatives. As weapons, they are surprisingly optional if you manage to skip the entire Iceberg and rank up fast enough, assuming you rush towards the Queso Fount Trap next.
The Oasis Water Node Trap could be considered a similar late-alternative, but is only considerworthy for players that manage to evade the iceberg, don't plan to head towards the Sunken City and have a very strong aversion for maps to get the Queso Fount Trap.
### Upgrades
After getting the Steam Lasers, the next stop is the [Queso Fount Trap](/weapons/hydro/qft). Alternatively, this one could be skipped, making the next stop the [Chrome School of Sharks](/weapons/hydro/csos).
