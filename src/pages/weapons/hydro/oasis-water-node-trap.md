 description="Working with some clever trapsmiths and the oasis bead you were able to create a tunnel of water and give it a mind of its own. While on standby the trap simply looks like a still pool of fresh water in a beautiful desert oasis, however any mouse it encounters will be snatched up and rocketed through the water tunnel to whatever destination you've set, be that Davy Jones' Locker or another continent. If this were big enough for a human and much safer, one might consider using it for a more cost effective travel method..."
