 description="The ultimate in steam laser technology, the Steam Laser Mk. III is truly a marvel of engineering. Able to hyper-heat steam beyond normal (or safe) levels, this trap is truly the pinnacle of anti-Iceberg weaponry. Even Icewing herself fears and will attack this trap on sight!

This combination of hot and hydro works especially well on the Slushy Shoreline and in the Iceberg."
