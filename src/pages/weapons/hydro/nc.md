## Ancient Spear Gun
This was made after T-Shirts were cool and may have lead to multiple lawsuits if it was used the same way.

### General Information
The Ancient Spear Gun and Net Cannon are the two first hydro weapons most hunters touch. The Net Cannon's functionality is quite short-lived: it can have some value when first conquering the S.S. Huntington, and then for some early Elub Shore/Shell cheese hunting towards the Ancient Spear needed to upgrade it. This shortlivedness is also why it didn't get its own page.
The Ancient Spear Gun has use for a bit longer, being useful for farming the rest of the Elub Shore, the Seasonal Garden and some use at the Slushy Shoreline to get the needed materials for the next hydro trap: the Steam Laser.

### Alternatives
While there are some whacky ways to find alternatives for a hydro weapon at this stage, none of them are solid enough alternatives to consider recommending them.
The Net Cannon can be swapped out for the Harpoon Gun, considering both provide the Launcher Parts needed for the Ancient Spear Gun, but the Net Cannon is generally considered strictly superior.

### Upgrades
After getting the Ancient Spear Gun, the next Hydro weapon to aim for is the [Steam Laser](/weapons/hydro/slmk). With some excessive shenanigans, this weapon could be skipped in which case the next step is the [Queso Fount Trap](/weapons/hydro/qft), but this is not recommended.
