 description="The Superior Unending Pollution Eradicating Reactor Soap Dispensing Pollution Disposal Unit, also known as the S.U.P.E.R. Scum Scrubber, is the next level of clean. An over-clocked, over-pressurized Pressure-MASTERâ„¢ 6500 blasts mice so hard that dirt comes off of places that they didn't even know were dirty! The extra-clean cleaning* gets the Crude Pollutinum residue that those other leading traps leave behind. Using this trap in the Toxic Spill while not actively refining Crude Pollutinum helps hunters find more Crude Pollutinum by collecting trace amounts of it from mice and dispensing a full glob of it into the hunter's refining barrel. Using this trap while refining Crude Pollutinum at the Toxic Spill will activate its super-scrubbing mode and refine an additional unit of Crude Pollutinum with each mouse a hunter catches!"
