 description="The ultimate upgrade for the ultimate aquatic predator! This fearsome trap is the perfect fusion of cutting edge technology with prehistoric predatory instincts. It takes all the ferocity of its predecessor and enhances it with chrome armour plating, ultra high-powered multi-wavelength laser emitters, and solid chrome teeth so sharp that they could slice through the hull of a battleship like it was a tin can... just imagine what they could do to a mouse!"
