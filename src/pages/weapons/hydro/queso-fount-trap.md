 description="A bubbling fount of molten queso which is superheated faster than it can vaporize. The surface tension is so high that even the slightest vibration can trigger an explosion! The specially crafted spouts focus the eruption towards the placement of the cheese on the trap hoping to cover any mice that wander too close."
