# General info and Trivia
The Chrome School of Sharks Trap is the final Hydro weapon hunters would look for. It can be acquired from the Sunken City, which has fairly little purpose progress-wise beyond this specific best-in-slot hydro weapon. Compared to other Best in Slot weapons on cost, the Chrome School of Sharks is somewhere in the middle. Its clearcut gold cost is on the higher end, but it is one of the few with quite little gold cost hidden away on the Marketplace.
This weapon is primarily used in the Floating Islands and the Folklore Forest's Prologue Pond. Like all best-in-slots, it has crown purposes as well, but a meaningful shoutout to give here is Twisted Carmine. She can be farmed a lot more efficiently with the Chrome School of Sharks, and her essences can provide quite some value.


# Alternatives
The Chrome School of Sharks Trap is the current best in slot Hydro weapon in the game. The Queso Fount Trap is the closest it has to an alternative, but will only carry you so far. Eventually, you will want the Chrome School of Sharks.
