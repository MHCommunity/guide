 description="What's the deal with pools, anyway? Mice go in, they splash around, they get *shudder* wet. . . Clearly there's no appeal there. Even water loving mice like to get out of the pool every now and then and get dry-- really, really dry. And the unbearable heat of the torch is a nice touch as well. It gives the whole trap the feel of the tropics. Now, mice won't have to go far from home to get that 'just sat out in the sun for eight hours' feeling!"
