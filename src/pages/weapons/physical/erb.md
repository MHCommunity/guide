## General Info and Trivia
The Enraged Rhinobot is probably tied with the A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. for being the most influential earlygame weapon. The reason for this is that it enables the strongest gold source for this stage of the game, namely the Derr Dunes. It also has extremely high stats for this early in the game. While this weapon has always been incredibly powerful, it became even more impactful after both getting its cost reduced alongside a nerf to the mice in Derr Dunes in March 2022.
Its high stats also make this weapon quite a useful pickup for events. (almost) All event mice are equally weak to all powertypes, making the enraged rhinobot with its 20 luck quite the powerhouse.
The Enraged Rhinobot is primarily used to further farm in the Derr Dunes (whenever gold might be a concern), the Seasonal Garden and the Fiery Warpath.

## Alternatives
While some whacky strategies exist that makes it possible to skip all of these weapons (untill you get to the very late stages of the game), as someone who has tried it, I would very strongly recommend against doing that.

## Upgrades
The next Physical weapon to aim at is either the [Chrome Monstrobot](/weapons/physical/cmb) or, if you are looking for a stopgap before going for the current best physical weapon, tbe [Smoldering Stone Sentinel Trap](/weapons/physical/ssst)
