# Physical - Earlygame

The earliest parts of physical are quite a mess with a lot of moving parts. Because of this, any physical weapon route before the Digby Drillbot is very hard to estimate. Thankfully, all these weapons are simply buyable in stores for nothing but gold. Despite that, here are a couple of guidelines:
- This section is applicable for all weapons up untill the Digby Drillbot. This weapon becomes considerable once a hunter reaches the Tribal Isles.
- If you are a donating player, the Shrink Ray Trap can probably cover this entire section
- To efficiently farm gold to upgrade your weapon in this stage of the game, (intelligently) using cheaper cheese can often help to get more gold per hunt on average. Unfonrtunately, the increased number of Faillures to Attract that come from this can be quite unfun making this not a strategy for everyone.
- The last step of this section is in almost all cases the Swiss Army Mouse Trap, which should be aimed at around the time when someone heads to the Mountain or the Calm Clearing.
- Neither the NVMRC Forcefield Trap, nor the Mouse Deathbot, are worth the money for their use.
