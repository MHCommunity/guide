 description="Warmth and the smell of baking cheese biscuits draw mice into this charming little gumdrop house, where they will find a present, waiting just for them. The mice unwrap the present, to find, in place of the cheese biscuits, a mouse-sized parachute. Once the mouse puts on the parachute, a burst of reverse Santa magic shoots it out the chimney, into the air to a land far away. Being flung into the air isn’t what the mouse had on its list, but it’s the thought that counts."
