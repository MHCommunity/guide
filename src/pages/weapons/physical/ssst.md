### Weapon Acquisition
The Smoldering Stone Sentinel Trap can be purchased in the Queso Geyser Trapsmith for 15,000,000 gold, 2,500 Solidified Amber Queso, 300 Nachore and 3 Geyser Smolder Stones.
- Solidified Amber Queso can be acquired from nests opened after any Eruption in Queso Geyser.
- Nachore is dropped by mice in Canterra Quarry.
- Geyser Smolder Stone can be found in Epic nests as a drop from Kalor'Ignis in Queso Geyser or bought from the Queso Geyser General Store. The recommended acquisition method, however, is the Marketplace, where they are incredibly cheap by comparison.

### General info & trivia
The Smoldering Stone Sentinel is one of the weapons introduced with the release of the Queso Geyser and is meant to be on par with the physical weapon introduced in the Sandtail Deset, the  [Chrome Monstrobot](/weapons/physical/cmb).
Its high power makes it appealing for some niche boss-smacking scenarios. This aside, it can be useful for M400-hunting, the Fiery Warpath, Muridae Market and the Floating Islands.

### Alternatives
This weapon is already an alternative, to the [Chrome Monstrobot](/weapons/physical/cmb), which is the current pre-Folklore Forest best-in-slot physical weapon. While the Chrome Monstrobot is often slightly better (luck vs power), the volatility in its price due to it needing a Chrome kit can make it the less desirable choice.

### Upgrades
This is (pre floating islands) a pseudo-Best In Slot weapon next to the abovementionned Chrome Monstrobot.
