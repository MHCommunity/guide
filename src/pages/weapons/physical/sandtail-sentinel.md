 description="Although the Muridae Market is heavily fortified, the Marching Flame still poses a significant threat. It was this threat which prompted the local Trapsmith to devise a sentinel powered by Flameshards. Able to sink its body into the sand, the Sandtail Sentinel patiently waits with its eyes just above the surface, waiting for a mouse to approach a baited base."
