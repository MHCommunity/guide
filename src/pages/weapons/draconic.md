## Beating up dragons and their natural predators

Once part of the end of the game, *Draconic* has evolved into a full-fledged powertype with multiple traps and tons of huntable mice. It is the powertype with least unused weapons. Hunting these dragons starts with slapping them with some ice, transitions into shooting them with a blazing spear, and finally a full-blown cannon!
