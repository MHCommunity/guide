 description="A significantly more powerful enchantment imbued by an ancient jewel transforms this winged crystal into a sentient familiar capable of strategic thinking. It can predict the movements of its quarry with remarkable accuracy which allows it to launch its golden circlet with impeccable timing and absolute precision. The Arcane power within this crystal is so potent that it can absorb the captured mouse's essence from a great distance which negates the need for its mighty and beautiful wings. However, now that the crystal is sentient, it chooses to keep the wings for reasons that can only be described as vanity."
