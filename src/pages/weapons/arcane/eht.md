### Weapon Acquisition
The Event Horizon Trap can be acquired from the Trapsmith in the Labyrinth and Zokor for 7,300,000 gold, 1 Essence of Destruction, 1 Sacred Script, 30 Scrap Metal and 225 Scholar Scrolls
- an Essence of Destruction can be looted from the Retired Minotaur, but more conventionally can be picked up from the Marketplace.
- A Sacred Script can be acquired by catching a Soul Binder in Zokor's highest tier Scholar district. Alternatively, they are very rare drops from Ful'Mina's Gifts and Ful'Mina, The Mountain Queen. It can also be acquired by smashing a Minotaur Key.
- Scrap Metal is dropped by many mice, including but not limited to Hydra mice in the Lagoon and Steel mice when using the Digby Drillbot. The latter is the current recommended route to farm it.
- Scholar scrolls are dropped in Zokor's Scholar district.

### General Info & Trivia
The Event Horizon Trap is the upgrade of the Droid Archmagus Trap and the former Best In Slot Arcane weapon. It can be used in Zokor's Farming district, but it's mainly intended for use in Moussu Picchu, an increase in catch rate for the Prickly Plains and the Arcane parts of the Floating Islands.
It had two Limited Edition upgrades, available during two seperate Great Winter Hunts. Like any Limited Edition content, these upgrades will never be available again.

### Alternatives
While the Event Horizon Trap has no viable alternatives, it is not the worst weapon in the game to skip. Moussu Picchu has multiple ways in which it can be cheesed to make the Droid Archmagus Trap sufficient, and the Floating Islands' design allow a hunter to avoid any powertype they don't want to use. The upgrade of this trap being available in the Floating Islands reinforces this sentiment.

### Upgrades
The next stop in unraveling the secrets of the Arcane is hidden on the Floating Islands in the sky, where a hunter can upgrade to the [Circlet of Pursuing](/weapons/arcane/eht)
