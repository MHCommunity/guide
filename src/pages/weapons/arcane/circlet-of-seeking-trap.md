 description="This magically-enchanted, golden circlet floats between two prongs that are charged with Arcane energy. Upon detection of a mouse, the circlet begins to rotate and gain momentum while the silk wrapping gauges the speed and direction of the prevailing winds. Using this information, the circlet makes subtle adjustments to its angular velocity before propelling itself towards its target at mach speed. Once the circlet makes contact, it suspends the mouse in a magical force field and holds it in place as the winged crystal flies over to absorb the rodent whole."
