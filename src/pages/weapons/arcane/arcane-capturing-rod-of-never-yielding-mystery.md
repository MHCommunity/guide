 description="This highly unstable trap setup is held in a constant state of metamorphosis by the unpredictable power of the Onyx stone. This trap almost appears alive, growing metal roots into whatever base to which it is attached. This trap's methods of capture are infinitely random. It can use its jagged metallic roots to impale mice, expel a thick and dark vapor that turns mice into stone, or bend space and time to erase the mouse from existence. Scientists of Digby warn hunters that the power of the Onyx stone is incredibly dangerous and fear that using this trap could lead to the end of the world"
