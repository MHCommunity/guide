Welcome to Physical the powertype of throwing hands.
Physical is the starting powertype, with as general theme physical power. It has a surprising amount of 'big robot slaps mouse' in it.
Physical is primarily used in the early stages of the game, after which it returns in the Derr Dunes, the Fiery Warpath, Muridae Market and eventually the Floating Islands. An honorable mention can go M400 and the Crystal Library as well.
