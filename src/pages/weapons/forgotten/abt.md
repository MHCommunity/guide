### General Info and Trivia
The Ancient Box Trap is the first Forgotten weapon most hunters will pick up. To find this ancient and forgotten technology, one must traverse the ocean and explore the Tribal Isles, collecting blueprints from the native tribes and looting the other components from the mighty beasts that lurk in the depths of the Jungle of Dread.
The Ancient Box is primarily used to hunt for the Acolyte in the Acolyte Realm. While this does make its use quite limited, the need to use Runic Cheese in the Acolyte Realm and the sheer difficulty of this challenge makes the weapon worthwhile regardless. Despite being this old (canonically), the Ancient Box Trap has had a number of minor changes since its introduction in 2009, most of them revolving around making it easier to access.

### Alternatives
Technically speaking, the Ancient Box Trap has an alternative, but this alternative is the most forgotten weapon in the game for a reason. The Forgotten Pressure Plate can be bought from the shop in Bristle Woods, but is significantly worse and requires a number of Runes to purchase. This makes the weapon very far from worthwhile, in comparison to the Ancient Box Trap that you essentially pick up 'along the way'. Its one very small strong point is that it is available slightly earlier for purchase, but by the time you have the resources to actually buy it you should just pick up the Ancient Box Trap anyway.

### Upgrades
The Ancient Box Trap is a good Forgotten weapon for a long time, because you'll be able to forget that it exists for an equally long time. After using it to catch your first Acolyte (and optionally first Eclipse, very optional but 'because I have to'-shoutout to Balack for being even worse), it gets put back on the shelf for an extended period of time. By the time you need it again, you'll already have picked up the next Forgotten weapon: the [Scarlet Ember Root Trap](/weapons/forgotten/sert).
