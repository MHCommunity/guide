# General info and Trivia
The Chrome Thought Obliterator Trap is the final step for Forgotten at this point in time, with no Forgotten weapon beating or contesting its place as the best available. It is one of the Floating Islands' "tier 2" weapons with a Chrome kit on top of that, making it a very expensive weapon.
The Chrome Thought Obliterator Trap is primarily used in the Floating Islands. This aside, there are no progress areas beyond it where this weapon is used. Before the upgrade, Forgotten is considered one of the worse powertypes to pick in the Floating Islands. Having an upgrade to alleviate this is very appealing, definitely for hunters who are aiming at crowns on the Forgotten Floating Islands mice.
It has been hinted that Forgotten will (eventually) be used in a boss-like area in the Folklore Forest as well, but the specifics on this are currently lacking, making it difficult to properly set expectations for this.

# Alternatives
The Chrome Thought Obliterator Trap is the current best in slot Forgotten weapon in the game.
<mark> DISCLAIMER: The following information is speculation </mark>
There are currently rumors that the Folklore Forest, the next permanent addition to the game, will have a stop-gap weapon for Forgotten. It will not beat the Chrome Thought Obliterator Trap in stats, but would be an alternative for the Thought Manipulator Trap if a hunter decides to not finish the Floating Islands' traps before heading to the Folklore Forest.
