 description="A mystical stone structure soaked in thought wave magnifying chrome. The resonance of the chrome amplifies the thought projections of the encased jewels, allowing them to grasp the minds of mice from further away. The mind erasure process is even faster as everything the mice experience is chrome! The jewels work their magic until the victim's mind is as spotless and shiny as the chrome itself."
