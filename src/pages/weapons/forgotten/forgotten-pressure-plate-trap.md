 description="This simple Forgotten trap is designed to blend in with the architecture found in the Acolyte Realm so as to avoid arising suspicion, and features a small, poisonous blowgun hidden within a simple stone column. Once a mouse steps on the pressure plate to collect the cheese, a volley of poisonous rune-tipped darts fire. Lethal or non-lethal poisons can be used depending on the will of the hunter."
