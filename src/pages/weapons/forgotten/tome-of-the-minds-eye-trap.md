 description="Atop this ancient pillar lies a tome of solid stone, open and waiting, since time immemorial. Etched onto its page is the mighty Mind's Eye, a powerful symbol that collects thoughts and memories from the surrounding environment to conceive the stories that fill its pages. As a mouse approaches this ominous, ageless book, the Mind's Eye begins to siphon their memories away while they gnaw obliviously on the cheese below. By the time they finish the final crumb, all of their memories have been forgotten from this world and sealed away as just another story within these infinite stone pages."
