## Weapon Acquisition
The Infinite Labyrinth Trap can be bought from the Trapsmith in the Labyrinth and Zokor for 1,800,000 gold, 1 Enigmatic Core, 1 Endless Labyrinth Trap, 1 Powercore Hammer and 225 Tech Power Cores.
- An Enigmatic Core can drop from the Retired Minotaur, but is more conventionally acquired from the Marketplace. This is because its price there has simply dropped that much since the area's release.
- A Powercore Hammer can be looted from the Manaforge Smith in Zokor's highest tier Tech district. Alternatively, it is a very rare drop from Ful'Mina's Gifts and Ful'Mina, The Mountain Queen. It can also be acquired by smashing a Minotaur Key.
- Tech Power Cores can be looted from mice in Zokor's Tech district.
- The Endless Labyrinth Trap can be bought in Zokor as well, and will be explained below.

# General Info and Trivia
Both the Infinite Labyrinth Trap and the Endless Labyrinth Trap are both acquired and used in the Labyrinth and Zokor. Considering Zokor's role as an area with three (former) best in slot weapons, the conventional strategy is to get to the Endless and Infinite Labyrinth first and go after the other two after. The Infinite Labyrinth can eventually be replaced with the Thought Manipulator Trap in the Floating Isles, which will directly lead to the current Forgotten Best in Slot weapon as well.

# Alternatives
The Infinite Labyrinth Trap does not have feasible alternatives. Yes it will hurt, just get them, you'll need them unless you want to get fancy beyond what this guide can offer you.

# Upgrades
The Infinite Labyrinth Trap has three very closely related upgrades to finish up the Forgotten powertype. These are the Thought Manipulator Trap, the Thought Obliterator Trap and the Chrome Thought Obliterator Trap. These three follow a direct upgrading line, requiring the previous step to craft the next. Details on these can be found on the [next](/weapons/forgotten/tot) page.
