 description="This upright stone formation stands inconspicuously awaiting a weary wanderer. While an unaware mouse sits at the base to rest and nibble on the cheese, the two jewels overhead silently activate. The first peers into the mind of the mouse to determine its innermost wants and desires while the second projects those desires onto the keyway beneath. Upon seeing the irresistible illusion, the mouse is compelled to step through the keyway into oblivion, never to return.

No one actually knows where the mice go but it is said that after stepping through, they are completely forgotten from history, as though they had never existed at all."
