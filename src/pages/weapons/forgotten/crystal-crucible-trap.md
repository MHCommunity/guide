 description="A perfectly arranged set of specifically sized and energized crystals. Once struck with a tuning fork, the resonating waves activate their energy causing a reaction between the crystals. Once fully awoken, the main grounding crystals hone and confine the smaller crystals into a powerful, circular orbit.

The crystals hum together producing a low-toned sound, attracting mice in the general area, luring them to its center ring. Once a mouse gets close enough the crystals spin and speed up into a blur and release an awesome flash of light. Too blinding to even see what has happened to the now missing mouse..."
