 description="This mystical stone structure possesses two immensely powerful jewels that actively seek out the thoughts of mice in the vicinity before they even become aware of it. The first of the two jewels draws the attention of unsuspecting mice with a projection of their desires directly into their mind. The images, sounds, and smells that they experience are completely indistinguishable from reality. The mice quickly become deeply entranced by this falsehood which lowers their mental guard and allows the second jewel to dig into their mind and erase its contents entirely. After forgetting who and where they are, they have no choice but to explore the attractive glowing keyway in front of them.

Once they pass through, they are erased from existence. Although, it has been theorized that the memory of their life and personality continues to exist trapped within the jewels for all eternity."
