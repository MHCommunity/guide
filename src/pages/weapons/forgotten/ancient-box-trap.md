 description="The ancient ghost mice which roamed Gnawnia before even the castle existed require an old-fashioned trap strategy, and the Ancient Box Trap is about as old-fashioned as they come. A heavy stone box teeters precariously upon an Ancient Relic Staff, waiting for a mouse to pull the Ethereal Rope and cause the box to slam shut and magically fuse with the base. This may seem like a deceptively simple trap set-up, but ancient mice enjoy the classics."
