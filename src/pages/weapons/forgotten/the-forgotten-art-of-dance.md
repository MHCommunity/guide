 description="Built by the smoothest and suavest dance scientists in Digby. This dance bot was created by modifying existing droids with extra suave servos and fully funk-tioning mechanical rhythm rotator cuffs, giving this droid the ability to get down! Mice trigger the dance challenge proximity sensor that starts the music and initiates a dance battle with the droid. Mice usually dance until they inevitably faint from exhaustion."
