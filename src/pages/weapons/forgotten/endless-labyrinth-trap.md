 description="Mice who try to steal cheese from this powerful trap are transported into a smaller, more twisted version of the Labyrinth. Only mice powerful or lucky enough manage to escape from this trap before it locks them within. The rest will live the remainder of their natural lives forgotten within this endless maze.
