 description="Expanding upon the previous principles of the Endless Labyrinth trap, this infinite beauty is quite a marvel indeed! The central core transports mice into a maze of infinite possibility. Each plate contains a miniverse of endless mazes that is in constant orbit around the central maze command core. As each plate passes through the core, they are reassembled with new passageways, completely reconfiguring the endless combinations.

The result is an infinite series of endless mazes with infinitely-changing configurations. If a mouse somehow impossibly manages to escape from one of the mazes, they simply pass into another section of a recently reconfigured maze plate. Truly maddening."
