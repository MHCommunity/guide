### Callouts

{% callout title="Here's some info!" %}
This is what a callout message looks like. You might want to include inline `code` in it. Or maybe you’ll want to include a [link](/) in it. I don’t think we should get too carried away with other scenarios like lists or tables — that would be silly.
{% /callout %}

{% callout type="warning" title="Oh no! Something bad happened!" %}
This is what a disclaimer message looks like. You might want to include inline `code` in it. Or maybe you’ll want to include a [link](/) in it. I don’t think we should get too carried away with other scenarios like lists or tables — that would be silly.
{% /callout %}

{% callout type="error" title="Oh no! Something bad happened!" %}
This is what a disclaimer message looks like. You might want to include inline `code` in it. Or maybe you’ll want to include a [link](/) in it. I don’t think we should get too carried away with other scenarios like lists or tables — that would be silly.
